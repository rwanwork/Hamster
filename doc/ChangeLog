  * All .h files:  Renamed all .h header files to .hpp
  * All .hpp/.cpp files:  Copyright was not at the top of every file; obvious oversight on my part!
  * All .hpp/.cpp files:  Added copyright year in the headers to say "2009-2011"
  * Migrated from Autoconf to CMake; directory structure completely modified.
  * Software released as v1.3

2010-02-23  Raymond Wan  <r.wan@aist.go.jp>
  * All .h/.cpp files:  Updated copyright year in the headers to say "2009-2010".
  * Directory structure:  Created a docs/ subdirectory for the PDF manuals (which were previously
                          in src/build/doxygen/ and src/layout/doxygen/.
  * build-mst:  Added a catch for the boost::lexical_cast exception to ensure data set values
                are doubles
  * build-mst:  Only tab characters are used to separate fields.
  * build-mst:  Added a sample name sanitizer that:
                  - Prepends numeric (integer) IDs with "X_".  This is because the merging process
                    introduces integers and causes problems.
                  - Removes quotation marks.
                  - Replaces each space with a hyphen ("-").
  * layout-mst:  The output file for graphviz surrounds node names with quotation marks in case the
                 node names have strange characters (hyphens, etc.).
  * Software released as v1.2.1

2009-11-12  Raymond Wan  <r.wan@aist.go.jp>
  * layout-mst:  Fixed bug in parameters.cpp where the "--filetype dot" option was not being recognized.

2009-10-11  Raymond Wan  <r.wan@aist.go.jp>
  * build-mst:  Renamed graph.cpp to kruskal_graph.cpp to open up the possibility of using
                other algorithms (such as Prim's).
  * Software released as v1.2.

2009-06-25  Raymond Wan  <r.wan@aist.go.jp>

  * All files:  Updated e-mail address contact information.
  * layout-mst:  Generation of each image takes into account of the node coordinates of the previous
                 image (i.e.,  in sequential order).  Thus, graphviz is now called twice in order to
                 produce the source DOT file and the image.  This option is on by default and is off
                 if MPI is enabled with more than one processor since MPI processes the images
                 independently in rank (and not sequential) order.
  * layout-mst:  Nodes are larger if they have more components inside them.  How large and how many
                 components is set in global_defn.h .  This option is off by default.
  * build-mst:   The node attribute file includes an additional field -- the number of components
                 inside each node.  This is to accommodate the previous feature of layout-mst.
  * Software released as v1.1.

2009-01-09  Raymond Wan  <rwan@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

  * build-mst, layout-mst:  Complete re-write; separated HAMSTER into
  two programs (v1.0)

2008-07-17  Raymond Wan  <rwan@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

  * hamster:  Release of HAMSTER (v0.9) for distribution.
